# CS305
This shows implementation of suppression files to limit known vulnerabilities with no know exploits, modification of pom.xml files to update maven dependency to the latest versions, aswell as implemenation of a SslServerController.Java file.
This is a SHA-512 encryption that follows the /hash port to encrypt a single line message input by the user.
This method of development detaches what the user inputs from the main code, aswell as encrypting the message input by the user with an ironclad means of encryption.
With more time/"encryption maxxing" I would add either a AES-256 and RSA hybrid encryption, or an AES CHA hybrid encryption. Either of these would increase the efficeny by 100 fold in the long run, but it is overkill for the assignment asked.
